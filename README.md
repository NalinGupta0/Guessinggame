# Guessinggame
This program will continuously ask the user to guess the number of files in the current directory, until they guess the correct number. The user will be informed if their guess is too high or too low. Once the user guesses the correct number of files in the current directory they should be congratulated. This project is attempted by Nalin Gupta as an assiment from the The Unix workbench in Coursera
